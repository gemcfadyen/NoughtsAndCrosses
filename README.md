NoughtsAndCrosses

Kata to simulate a game of noughts and crosses

Following on from a LSCC (London Software Craftsmanship Communit) hands on session where we had to implement solutions to the tic-tac-toe game, upload them to a server and play against each other, I decided to implement a game of noughts and crosses such that one player is you, the human, whilst the other is your program.

As a starting point the player to go first is randomly generated by the game.  A random seed is used for this so that in testing, I can determine who the first player will be.
